# Test Oracle AIDP Codex Plugins

This folder is a Codex plugin marketplace hosted inside `oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples`.

## Add Marketplace

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples \
    --ref main \
    --sparse .agents \
    --sparse ai/codex-plugins
codex plugin marketplace list
```

Expected marketplace name:

```text
oracle-aidp-codex
```

> **Path resolution:** Codex validates the repository-root
> `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and resolves each `source.path` from that root.
> The sparse checkout must include both `.agents` and `ai/codex-plugins`; therefore
> `"path": "./ai/codex-plugins/plugins/<name>"` resolves to the installed plugin
> directory. Confirm with `codex plugin list` — the PATH column should point at
> `…/ai/codex-plugins/plugins/<name>`.

## Install Engineer Agent

```bash
codex plugin add oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-engineer-agent@oracle-aidp-codex
```

Start a new Codex thread after install.

## Engineer Agent Prerequisites

- Codex CLI installed and signed in.
- Python 3.10 or newer on `PATH`.
- OCI CLI configured with a working `DEFAULT` API key profile.
- An AIDP DataLake, workspace, and reachable Spark cluster.

Set the runtime environment:

```bash
export AIDP_REGION=<your-region>
export AIDP_DATALAKE=<your-datalake-ocid>
export AIDP_WORKSPACE=<your-workspace-id>
export AIDP_CLUSTER=<your-cluster-key>
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:AIDP_REGION = "<your-region>"
$env:AIDP_DATALAKE = "<your-datalake-ocid>"
$env:AIDP_WORKSPACE = "<your-workspace-id>"
$env:AIDP_CLUSTER = "<your-cluster-key>"
```

## Engineer Agent Smoke Flow

Ask Codex these in a new thread:

```text
Set up and verify my AIDP connection.
```

```text
Map my catalog - what data do I have?
```

```text
What were my total net store sales, transactions and customers, and how are sales spread across stores?
```

```text
Using AI right inside the SQL, give me a business read on how sales are distributed across stores.
```

```text
Show the version history of a Delta table and optimize it.
```

## Install Databricks Migrator

```bash
codex plugin add oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-databricks-migrator@oracle-aidp-codex
