# Ask AIDP Codex Plugin

This plugin connects Codex to Oracle AI Data Platform Workbench through CLI commands with a REST API as a backup. Use this for general work such as to create workflows, clusters and even upload notebooks.

## Requirements

- Codex CLI with plugin support and Node.js available to Codex.
- OCI config and credentials that can access the target AIDP instance.
- The latest `aidp-cli` from
  [`oracle-samples/aidataplatform-sdk`](https://github.com/oracle-samples/aidataplatform-sdk),
  either on `PATH` or selected with `AIDP_CLI_BIN`.
- The latest `aidp-typescript-client` and `oci-common` packages when using the
  native SDK workspace Git tools.

This GitHub directory is the plugin's source distribution. It does **not** contain
generated `dist/` tarballs, zip files, or a vendored `node_modules` tree. Install the
plugin from the GitHub marketplace as described below. The build script can create
offline archives for a separate release process, but those archives are not published
here.

For file work in notebooks, use AIDP Workbench path patterns such as `/Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/<volume>/<file>`, `/Workspace/<folder>/<file>`, `file:///Volumes/...`, `file:///Workspace/...`, and `oci://<bucket>@<namespace>/<folder-or-file>`.

If both `aidp-cli` and the TypeScript SDK fail for an operation, fall back to the documented Oracle AI Data Platform Workbench REST API only when the needed endpoint is present in the REST catalog.

## Install From GitHub

The same marketplace commands work on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Register the
Oracle AIDP marketplace once:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples \
    --ref main \
    --sparse .agents \
    --sparse ai/codex-plugins
```

Install Ask AIDP:

```bash
codex plugin add ask-aidp@oracle-aidp-codex
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
codex plugin list
```

Start a new Codex thread after installation so the Ask AIDP skill and MCP tools
are loaded. You do not need to download an archive, extract a plugin directory,
or create `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` manually.

To update an existing installation:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade oracle-aidp-codex
codex plugin add ask-aidp@oracle-aidp-codex
```

Then start another new Codex thread.

## Configure AIDP

Use [`examples/aidp.env.sample`](./examples/aidp.env.sample) as the template. Do
not distribute a completed `aidp.env`, because it identifies a user's OCI profile,
AIDP instance, workspace, and cluster.

On macOS or Linux, download and load the sample from the shell that launches
Codex:

```sh
curl -L \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples/main/ai/codex-plugins/plugins/ask-aidp/examples/aidp.env.sample \
  -o aidp.env.sample
cp aidp.env.sample aidp.env
chmod 600 aidp.env
# Replace every placeholder before loading the file.
source ./aidp.env
```

On Windows PowerShell, download the sample as a reference and set the equivalent
environment variables in the PowerShell session that launches Codex:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples/main/ai/codex-plugins/plugins/ask-aidp/examples/aidp.env.sample" `
  -OutFile ".\aidp.env.sample"

$env:AIDP_ENDPOINT = "https://aidp.<region>.oci.oraclecloud.com"
$env:AIDP_OCID = "ocid1.aidataplatform..."
$env:AIDP_WORKSPACE_KEY = "<workspace-key>"
$env:AIDP_CLUSTER_KEY = "<cluster-key>"
$env:OCI_PROFILE = "DEFAULT"
$env:AIDP_AUTH = "api_key"
```

Set `AIDP_CLI_BIN` when `aidp` is not already on `PATH`:

```sh
export AIDP_CLI_BIN="/absolute/path/to/aidp"
```

```powershell
$env:AIDP_CLI_BIN = "C:\path\to\aidp.cmd"
```

If `oci login` does not work, configure OCI API key authentication using
[Oracle's API signing key instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two).
Set `AIDP_AUTH=api_key`, select the profile with `OCI_PROFILE`, and set
`OCI_CONFIG_FILE` when the OCI config is not in its default location.

## Use

Example prompts:

```text
Use Ask AIDP to check my workspace connection.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create five sample notebooks, run them in sequence, and download logs.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to run: workflow list-jobs <workspace-key> --limit 10
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to look up the docs for schema create-table.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to search the AIDP CLI reference for registered model commands.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create a 7-notebook workflow and run it.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to upload this local src directory into /Workspace/project/src.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to connect my workspace to this Git repository on branch main.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create bronze, silver, and gold schemas for my lakehouse catalog.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create a bundle for this job and deploy the bundle.
```

For generic commands, the plugin passes an argument array to `aidp-cli` and appends common endpoint, instance, profile, auth, and timeout flags from the environment.

The generated CLI reference covers these command groups: `async-operations`, `audit`, `bundle`, `catalog`, `cluster`, `credentials`, `delta-share`, `mlops`, `notebook`, `role`, `schema`, `user-setting`, `volume`, `workflow`, `workspace`, and `workspace-object`. Use `aidp_cli_reference` to list groups, list commands in a group, fetch one command reference, or search all documented commands.

Convenience tool prompts:

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create a schema named finance_sandbox in my catalog.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to list all active external catalogs sorted by display name.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to get catalog details for <catalog-key>.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to dry-run creating an internal catalog named finance_lakehouse.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create a managed Delta table with id and amount columns.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to create a managed table named sample_orders and insert these rows into it.
```

```text
Use Ask AIDP to dry-run creating an ADW external catalog with these connection properties.
```

The create-schema, create-Delta-table, create-table-with-data, create-catalog, and create-external-catalog tools support `dryRun` so users can inspect the generated `aidp-cli` command and JSON body before creating resources. Catalog list/get tools also support `dryRun` for command inspection.

`aidp_create_table_with_data` wraps `aidp schema create-data-table`. It creates a new managed table and loads initial data from one of:

- `rows`, which the tool stages as CSV using `schema generate-temp-file-upload-target`;
- `localDataFile`, which the tool stages through the same temporary upload target;
- `objectStorageLocationPath`, when the data file is already in object storage.

This is an initial-load workflow for a newly-created managed table. For appending rows to an existing table, use `aidp_cli` or a notebook/workflow if that operation is exposed by your AIDP environment.

Auto-heal workflow prompt:

```text
Use Ask AIDP to dry-run auto-healing job run <job-run-key>.
```

`aidp_auto_heal_workflow` inspects the job run, selects failed task keys by default, and wraps `aidp workflow repair-job-run`. It can also accept explicit `taskKeys`, rerun parameters, and `pollToCompletion`.

## Evidence

Workflow runs create a local evidence directory with:

- request JSON files;
- raw CLI responses;
- `commands-and-responses.md`;
- task output exports;
- cluster log responses;
- `summary.json`.

## Limitations

- The plugin wraps `aidp-cli`; it does not bypass CLI behavior, validation, throttling, or service-side permissions.
- Live operations require network access to OCI and valid OCI credentials.
- The plugin does not manage OCI key generation or IAM policy setup.
- `aidp_cli` is intentionally argument-array based and does not execute shell pipelines, redirects, or scripts.
- Long-running workflows depend on cluster availability and can time out if the service run exceeds the configured polling timeout.
- Task output export depends on AIDP returning an output key for the task run.
- `aidp_create_table_with_data` uses `schema create-data-table`, which creates a managed table with an initial data load. It is not a general-purpose append/merge command for existing tables.
- The GitHub marketplace source does not include generated archives or vendored
  Node dependencies. Install `aidp-cli` separately and set `AIDP_CLI_BIN` or
  `PATH`; native workspace Git tools additionally require
  `aidp-typescript-client` and `oci-common` to be resolvable by the MCP server.
