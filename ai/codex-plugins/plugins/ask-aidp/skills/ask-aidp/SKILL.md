# Ask AIDP

Use this skill for Oracle AI Data Platform Workbench tasks that should be performed with `aidp-cli`.

## Preferred Tooling

When the Ask AIDP MCP tools are available, prefer them over shelling out manually:

- `aidp_create_git_folder`: connect to Git and fetch code into a Git-backed AIDP workspace folder.
- `aidp_git_commit_push`: use the native TypeScript SDK `GitClient` to stage files, commit, and push a Git-backed workspace folder.
- `aidp_git_pull`: use the native TypeScript SDK `GitClient` to pull remote changes into a Git-backed workspace folder.
- `aidp_git_get_repository`: use the native TypeScript SDK `GitClient` to fetch connected repository metadata.

- `aidp_create_schema`: create a schema from catalog name and display name.
- `aidp_create_delta_table`: create a managed or external Delta table from catalog/schema keys and typed column inputs.
- `aidp_create_table_with_data`: create a managed table and load initial data from inline rows, a local data file, or an existing object storage path.
- `aidp_generate_csv_table_sql`: generate `%sql CREATE TABLE ... USING CSV OPTIONS (... header 'true')` for CSV-backed tables whose first row contains headers.
- `aidp_list_catalogs`: list catalogs with typed filters for display name, state, type, pagination, and sort order.
- `aidp_get_catalog`: get details for one catalog by key or GUID.
- `aidp_create_catalog`: create an internal or external catalog with simplified typed inputs.
- `aidp_create_external_catalog`: create an external catalog with source type and connection properties.
- `aidp_auto_heal_workflow`: inspect failed workflow task runs and repair/rerun selected tasks with `workflow repair-job-run`.
- `aidp_create_medallion_architecture`: create bronze/silver/gold medallion schemas from scratch.
- `aidp_create_bundle`: create bundles for jobs or agent flows.
- `aidp_deploy_bundle`: deploy bundles and optionally fetch deployment status.
- `aidp_cli`: run any `aidp-cli` command group or command not covered by the higher-level tools.
- `aidp_command_help`: inspect `aidp-cli` command groups and command help.

- `aidp_rest_api_reference`: summarize, search, or inspect the generated catalog of documented REST operations.
- `aidp_rest`: make an OCI-signed request to any method/path pair in the documented REST catalog.

If tools are not available, use `aidp-cli` directly with argument arrays or shell commands. For workspace code upload and Git repository push, pull, status, diff, branch, merge, rebase, and reset operations, prefer the native SDK-backed tools.

## Full CLI Coverage

The plugin supports all documented `aidp-cli` command groups through `aidp_cli`, and the generated command catalog in `CLI_COMMANDS.md` lists every documented command. Use `aidp_cli_reference` before a raw `aidp_cli` call when you need usage, request-body fields, command summaries, or to search the full command catalog.

Documented command groups covered by the plugin:

- `agent`
- `async-operations`
- `audit`
- `bundle`
- `catalog`
- `cluster`
- `credentials`
- `data-lineage`
- `delta-share`
- `mlops`
- `notebook`
- `role`
- `schema`
- `user-setting`
- `volume`
- `workflow`
- `workspace`
- `workspace-object`

## Configuration

Prefer environment variables so commands are reproducible:

- `AIDP_ENDPOINT`
- `AIDP_OCID` or `AIDP_INSTANCE_ID`
- `AIDP_WORKSPACE_KEY`
- `AIDP_CLUSTER_KEY`
- `OCI_PROFILE`
- `OCI_CONFIG_FILE`
- `AIDP_AUTH` such as `api_key`, `security_token`, `instance_principal`, or `resource_principal`
- `AIDP_CLI_BIN` when `aidp` is not on `PATH`

If `oci login` or security-token authentication does not work for the user, guide them to configure OCI API key authentication with Oracle's API signing key process: <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two>. The required setup is an IAM user with the needed AIDP permissions, a PEM RSA API signing key pair, the public key uploaded in OCI Console under User settings > API Keys, the generated config snippet copied into `~/.oci/config` or `%USERPROFILE%\.oci\config`, `key_file` updated to the private key path, and private-key permissions restricted to the user. Then set `AIDP_AUTH=api_key`, `OCI_PROFILE` to that config profile, and `OCI_CONFIG_FILE` when the config file is not in the default location.

For live operations that create or update resources, write evidence to a local run folder and report:

- notebook paths
- job key
- job run key
- final job run status
- task run statuses
- transcript path
- log/output artifact paths

When generating notebooks, organize code into focused cells with comments. Keep setup/common values together, keep related work together, and keep validation/output markers together. For SQL notebooks, preserve `%sql` as the first line of the SQL cell and use SQL comments (`-- ...`) inside that cell.

For catalog/schema/table creation and lookup, prefer the dedicated convenience tools when their input shape fits. Use `aidp_list_catalogs` for "show/list/get catalogs", `aidp_get_catalog` for one catalog, `aidp_create_catalog` for general catalog creation, and `aidp_create_external_catalog` when the user specifically wants an external catalog. Use `dryRun: true` first when the user is deciding on names, keys, table columns, source type, connection properties, or sample data. Use `aidp_create_table_with_data` when the user asks to create a table and insert or load initial data into it. Be clear that this wraps `schema create-data-table` for a new managed table with an initial load; inline rows are staged as headerless CSV with positional `selectedColumns` (`_c0`, `_c1`, ...) while `tableFields` carries the real names and types. For appending to an existing table, use `aidp_cli` or a notebook/workflow if the environment exposes that operation.

For CSV-backed tables where the first row should be treated as column headers, prefer `aidp_generate_csv_table_sql` and run the generated SQL in an AIDP notebook or workflow. The generated SQL should use `USING CSV` and `OPTIONS (path '<path>', header 'true')`, matching the documented notebook SQL pattern.

For workflow healing, prefer `aidp_auto_heal_workflow`. Use `dryRun: true` first unless the user clearly asks to perform the repair. If task keys are omitted, the tool selects task runs with failed/error statuses from the target job run.

For workspace code, use `aidp_upload_workspace_code` for local files/directories and `aidp_create_git_folder` for Git-backed workspace folders. Uploads route through the TypeScript SDK `WorkspaceObjectClient`; dry-run returns request placeholders without reading or base64-encoding file contents. For Git push/pull/status/diff/branch workflows inside a Git-backed workspace folder, use the `aidp_git_*` tools; these route through the TypeScript SDK `GitClient`. Prefer passing `gitFolderPath`; when `gitRepositoryKey` is omitted, the plugin resolves it with `WorkspaceObjectClient#listWorkspaceObjects` and the Git folder metadata `repoKey`. Use dry-run before uploading many files or performing mutating Git operations.

For file paths in notebooks, follow AIDP Workbench file access patterns:

- Volumes: `/Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/<volume>/<file>` for POSIX-style volume access.
- Workspace files: `/Workspace/<folder>/<file>` for POSIX-style workspace access.
- URI-style local paths: `file:///Volumes/...` or `file:///Workspace/...`.
- OCI Object Storage: `oci://<bucket>@<namespace>/<folder-or-file>`.

Use Spark reads such as `spark.read.csv(path, header=True, inferSchema=True, sep=",")` or pandas reads such as `pd.read_csv(path, header=0, sep=",")` when generating notebook examples.

For medallion architecture, use `aidp_create_medallion_architecture` to create bronze, silver, and gold schemas, then use `aidp_create_delta_table` to add empty Delta tables or `aidp_create_table_with_data` to seed managed tables with initial data in each layer.

For new bundle publishing workflows, look up `bundle publish-bundle-action` and `bundle fetch-publish-status-action` with `aidp_cli_reference`, then invoke them through `aidp_cli`. Both REST equivalents use POST under the workspace path: `actions/publishBundle` and `actions/getBundlePublishStatus`. Prefer the operation reference over the inconsistent GET entry in the What's New page. The legacy `aidp_deploy_bundle` helper retains deprecated deployment commands for compatibility; use it only when that older flow is requested. Use `aidp_create_bundle` to create bundles and inspect the current CLI reference for sync/purge operations.

The September 21, 2026 reference snapshot covers 256 CLI commands in 18 groups and 271 REST operations in 19 categories. The REST API version is `/20260430`. Use `aidp_cli_reference` for CLI discovery and `aidp_rest_api_reference` for the canonical REST method/path, then run `aidp_rest` with `dryRun: true`. The tool expands configured AIDP/workspace/cluster identifiers, signs live calls with the configured OCI identity, and rejects endpoint/method pairs absent from its catalog. Report the endpoint, method, request body path, response status, and evidence.

New reference coverage includes Data Lineage, bundle publishing, Compute cloning/configuration import/export, Maven search, volume/workspace ZIP operations, and task-run retry inspection. These are accessed through the generic CLI and REST tools. A catalog refresh does not upgrade the external CLI runtime: check `aidp_command_help` before using a newly added command, and update the CLI or use its documented REST equivalent if the installed version does not support it. Read each operation's request schema and preview restrictions before execution; a successful dry run validates routing, not the request payload or service behavior.

## Safety

For Compute configuration export, use the `ExportComputeConfigurationDetails`
root payload, not the nested `ComputeConfigurationLibraryEntry` model.
`aidp_rest` defaults this POST to `Accept: application/x-yaml`; preview effective
headers with `dryRun: true`. On an enabled instance, verify export success and
read back the created YAML. Report feature-disabled 403 responses as blocked
validation, not a passed export or evidence that the payload is valid.

`aidp_cli` accepts an argument array, not a shell string. Do not embed shell operators. Use the `body` argument for JSON request bodies instead of writing one-off shell heredocs.
