# Oracle AI Data Platform — Databricks Migrator (Codex CLI plugin)

> **Migrate Databricks notebooks, jobs, and catalogs onto Oracle AIDP — in natural language.**
> Drives the *AIDP Databricks Migration Toolkit* (an agentic migrator that runs cells live on the AIDP cluster, verifies, and self-fixes) end-to-end from the OpenAI Codex CLI.

> **Canonical home:** [`oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples/ai/codex-plugins/plugins/oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-databricks-migrator`](https://github.com/oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples/tree/main/ai/codex-plugins/plugins/oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-databricks-migrator).

This plugin is **self-contained for Codex**: it ships the OpenAI-based Python migration engine under `engine/`. On SessionStart, the hook stages that engine to `~/.aidp-migrator/engine` so Codex can run migrations without a separate toolkit clone.

> **Status:** **v0.2.0** - self-contained Codex release with the bundled OpenAI-based migration engine.

### What gets automated end-to-end

```

                                                          • source format preserved (Delta stays Delta)

                                                         logs / model eval), up to 10 fix attempts,
                                                         fixup_cell rewind for replays.
                                                 Output: per-job .ipynb + JOB_REPORT.md
```

### Signature differentiators

- **Cell-by-cell execute / verify / fix loop** — the migrator runs each Databricks-rewritten cell on a live AIDP cluster, parses the output, and self-corrects via a model with tool use (14 tools: `explore_path`, `suggest_oci_path`, `search_catalog`, `run_on_cluster`, `describe_table`, `list_schemas_and_tables`, `read_notebook_source`, `inspect_package_source`, `summarize_notebook`, `submit_code`, `make_note`, `get_cell_history`, `get_history_entry`, `fixup_cell`).
- **Write-redirect sandbox schema** — source data is never touched during migration. Every `.saveAsTable(...)` / `INSERT INTO` is silently redirected to a sandbox schema, then verified post-run.
- **Acceptance contract** — for batch / streaming pipelines, declare PASS only after K consecutive empty-pending windows (consecutive-zero convergence).

## When to use this plugin

You're moving a Databricks workload onto AIDP and want Codex to drive the whole port. Typical asks:

- *"Migrate this Databricks job to AIDP"* / *"port my workflow"*
- *"Build a migration manifest from this Databricks workspace path"*
- *"My migrated notebook fails at cell 23 — fix it"*
- *"Migrate the Unity Catalog DDL into the AIDP default catalog"*
- *"Check whether the source tables are available before I migrate"*
- *"Resume the migration from task X"*
- *"Set up the acceptance contract for the streaming task"*

---

## Install

The plugin lives in the `oracle-aidp-codex` marketplace, which is hosted as a sparse-checkout subdir of `oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples`.

```bash
# Register the marketplace (one-time)
codex plugin marketplace add oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples \
    --ref main \
    --sparse .agents \
    --sparse ai/codex-plugins

# Install the plugin
codex plugin add oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-databricks-migrator@oracle-aidp-codex
```

Update later:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade oracle-aidp-codex
```

Verify it's enabled:

```bash
codex plugin list | grep databricks-migrator
```

---

## Prerequisites

This plugin bundles the migrator engine. To actually run migrations, you need:

1. **Python dependencies for the bundled engine** - after installing the plugin and starting a new Codex thread, the SessionStart hook stages the engine to `~/.aidp-migrator/engine`. Install dependencies once:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r ~/.aidp-migrator/engine/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **OCI authentication** - `~/.oci/config` with either an `api_key` profile (recommended for unattended runs) or an `oci session authenticate` session-token profile (for interactive notebooks). The migrator reads whichever profile the operator selects via `--oci-profile`.

3. **An ACTIVE AIDP cluster** - the migrator's Pass-2 execute/verify/fix loop talks to a live cluster via WebSocket. The cluster must be in `Active` state before invoking `job_migrate.py`.

4. **An OpenAI API key** - set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the shell before running Pass-2. Optionally set `OPENAI_MODEL` to your team's approved OpenAI model.

Once those are in place, the plugin's skills know how to invoke each entrypoint — Codex will run the right CLI commands in the right order based on your natural-language ask.

## Skill index

### Foundation
| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aidp-migrator-overview` | Router. Read this first to get the lay of the toolkit + which skill handles which phase. |
| `aidp-migrator-bootstrap` | One-shot environment readiness check (Python deps, OCI auth, cluster state, env-coords file). |

### Plan
| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aidp-build-dag` | Build a migration manifest (`reports/<job>_manifest.json`) from a Databricks workspace path. Walks `%run` chains, emits the execution DAG. |
| `aidp-check-data` | Pre-migration scan: verify source tables / paths exist on the AIDP cluster before kicking off. |
| `check-data-flow` | Guided variant of `aidp-check-data` with explicit OK / MISSING / EMPTY summary + remediation routing. |

### Execute
| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aidp-migrate-job` | Run the migrator end-to-end against a manifest. Pass-1 deps + Pass-2 cell-by-cell on the live cluster. |
| `aidp-fixup-cell` | Targeted rewind: re-execute cells from history index N with a `why` reason, through execute+verify+fix. |
| `aidp-resume-migration` | Resume an interrupted run. Skips already-migrated notebooks via `_migration_cache` + on-cluster `os.path.exists()`. |
| `migrate-job-flow` | Guided full-job migration with phase checkpoints (DAG → check-data → migrate → status). |

### Catalog
| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aidp-migrate-catalog` | Extract Unity Catalog / HMS metadata → 18-rule DDL rewriter → batched replay on AIDP. |
| `aidp-bucket-mapping` | Configure `s3://` → `oci://` bucket/namespace mappings the rewriter consumes. |
| `migrate-catalog-flow` | Guided catalog migration (extract → rewrite preview → batched replay) with stop points. |

### Verify
| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aidp-acceptance-contract` | YAML-driven consecutive-zero-window acceptance for batch / streaming convergence. |
| `migration-status` | Parse + summarize a `JOB_REPORT.md` from a previous run. |
| `databricks-notebook-analyzer` | Read a Databricks notebook + report what it does, dependencies, risks (drives Pass-1 planning). |
| `migration-reviewer` | Review a migrated `.ipynb` post-Pass-2 for correctness (Spark API drift, `%run` trailing-slash, builtins.sum shadow, etc.). |

### References (loaded on demand)
| Reference | Use |
|---|---|
| [`references/ddl-rewrite-rules.md`](./references/ddl-rewrite-rules.md) | The 18 DDL rewrite rules the catalog migrator applies, with input/output examples. |
| [`references/gotchas.md`](./references/gotchas.md) | 15 Databricks → AIDP gotchas + fix recipes. |

## Engine

Everything flows through the bundled migrator CLI staged under `~/.aidp-migrator/engine`:

```bash
# Inventory & plan
python3 $HOME/.aidp-migrator/engine/scripts/build_dag.py --root <workspace-path> --job-name <name> --output reports/<name>_manifest.json
python3 $HOME/.aidp-migrator/engine/scripts/check_data_availability.py --root <workspace-path> --cluster <cluster-id>

# Execute
python3 $HOME/.aidp-migrator/engine/scripts/job_migrate.py \
  --manifest reports/<name>_manifest.json \
  --cluster <cluster-id> \
  --aidp-base https://aidp.<region>.oci.oraclecloud.com/20240831 \
  --datalake-ocid <your-datalake-ocid> \
  --workspace-id <your-workspace-uuid> \
  --output-base <output-workspace-path> \
  --oci-profile <profile-name>

# Catalog (separate flow)
python3 $HOME/.aidp-migrator/engine/scripts/extract_catalog_databricks.py --catalogs <catalog> --schemas-only "<catalog>:<schema>" --out reports/catalog_pack.json
python3 $HOME/.aidp-migrator/engine/scripts/migrate_catalog.py --pack reports/catalog_pack.json --cluster <cluster-id> --aidp-base ... --datalake-ocid ...
```

The skills tell Codex when to call each + how to thread args from the env-coords reference into them.
